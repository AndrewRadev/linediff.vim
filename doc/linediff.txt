INSTALLATION                                           *linediff-installation*

There are several ways to install the plugin. The recommended one is by using
Tim Pope's pathogen (http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2332). In
that case, you can clone the plugin's git repository like so:
>
    git clone git://github.com/AndrewRadev/linediff.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/linediff
<
If your vim configuration is under git version control, you could also set up
the repository as a submodule, which would allow you to update more easily.
The command is (provided you're in ~/.vim):
>
    git submodule add git://github.com/AndrewRadev/linediff.vim.git bundle/linediff
<

Another way is to simply copy all the essential directories inside the ~/.vim
directory: plugin, autoload, doc.

==============================================================================
USAGE                                                         *linediff-usage*

The plugin provides a simple command, |:Linediff|, which is used to diff two
separate blocks of text.

A simple example:
>
    def one
      two
    end

    def two
      three
    end
<
If we mark the first three lines, starting from "def one", in visual mode, and
execute the |:Linediff| command, the signs "1-" will be placed at the start
and at the end of the visual mode's range. Doing the same thing on the bottom
half of the code, starting from "def two", will result in the signs "2-"
placed there. After that, a new tab will be opened with the two blocks of code
in vertical splits, diffed against each other.

The two buffers are temporary, but when any one of them is saved, its original
buffer is updated. Note that this doesn't save the original buffer, just
performs the change. Saving is something you should do later.

Executing the command |:LinediffReset| will delete the temporary buffers and
remove the signs.

Executing a new |:Linediff| will do the same as |:LinediffReset|, but will
also initiate a new diff process.

The statuslines of the two temporary buffers will be changed to contain:
    - The original buffer
    - The starting line of the selected segment
    - The ending line of the selected segment

If you're using a custom statusline and it contains "%f" (the current file's
name), that token will simply be substituted by the above data. Otherwise, the
entire statusline will be set to a custom one.

If you'd rather the statusline is left untouched, you can set the
|g:linediff_modify_statusline| setting to 0. You can still access the buffer
description via `b:differ.description`.

If you'd like to do some additional setup on the buffers, you can hook into
the `LinediffBufferReady` User autocommand. For instance, in order to stop the
linediff with a `q`, try:
>
    autocmd User LinediffBufferReady nnoremap <buffer> q :LinediffReset<cr>
<

Diffing more than two areas ~

If you'd like to diff more than two areas of code, you can use the
|:LinediffAdd| command after the first |:Linediff| to mark more areas. You can
then call |:LinediffShow| to open the diff:
>
    :1,2Linediff
    :3,4LinediffAdd
    :5,6LinediffAdd
    :LinediffShow
<
This will diff the three specified areas. Alternatively, you can use the
|:LinediffLast| command to add and show the differ. So, the above code is
equivalent to:
>
    :1,2Linediff
    :3,4LinediffAdd
    :5,6LinediffLast
<
Note that there's a hard limit of 8 diffs set by Vim, so you can't diff more
areas than that.

Diffing merges ~

If you have a merge conflict like this one:
>
    def one
    <<<<<<< master
      "first"
    =======
      "second"
    >>>>>>> branch
    end
<
You can easily start a diff between the two variants of the code by executing
the |:LinediffMerge| command. You can use the diffed buffers the same way, or,
you can use |:LinediffPick| to choose one buffer whose contents will replace
the entire merge conflict. This also works with three-way diffs:
>
    def one
    <<<<<<< master
      "first"
    |||||||
      "second"
    =======
      "third"
    >>>>>>> branch
    end
<
The statuslines of the diff buffers will hold the label of the merge parent
for convenience. Also for convenience, executing |:LinediffPick| directly on
the merge area will pick the area without going through the merge buffers first.

==============================================================================
COMMANDS                                                   *linediff-commands*

                                                                     *:Linediff*
:[range]Linediff

The main interface of the plugin. Needs to be executed on a range of lines,
which will be marked with a sign. On the selection of the second such range,
the command will open a tab with the two ranges in vertically split windows
and perform a diff on them. Saving one of the two buffers will automatically
update the original buffer the text was taken from.

When executed for a third time, a new line diff is initiated, and the current
process is reset, much like the effect of |LinediffReset| would be.


                                                                *:LinediffReset*
:LinediffReset[!]

Removes the signs denoting the diffed regions and deletes the temporary
buffers, used for the diff. The original buffers are untouched by this, which
means that any updates to them, performed by the diff process will remain.
Specifying ! discards unsaved changes made in the temporary buffers.


                                                                  *:LinediffAdd*
:[range]LinediffAdd

Adds a buffer to be diffed later. This is an interface that allows diffing
more than two areas. Should be followed by another "Add", or by "Show" or
"Last" to finish the process of adding areas.


                                                                 *:LinediffShow*
:LinediffShow

Shows the diff between all of the marked areas. This is useful if you've been
adding areas with |:LinediffAdd| and you're ready to see their diff.


                                                                 *:LinediffLast*
:[range]LinediffLast

Performs a combination of |:LinediffAdd| and |:LinediffShow|. Considers the
marked area to be the last one added to the diff buffers and opens the diff.


                                                                *:LinediffMerge*
:LinediffMerge

Looks for merge markers around the cursor, takes their contents and renders
them in a diff. The diff buffers act like normal diff buffers, updating their
parent buffer, but you can call |:LinediffPick| to pick one of them to replace
the entire merge conflict area.


                                                                 *:LinediffPick*
:LinediffPick

After a |:LinediffMerge|, in a diff buffer -- picks the diff buffer you're in
as the "correct" one to replace the entire merge conflict area in the parent
buffer.

Without a |:LinediffMerge| -- picks the area within a merge to replace the
entire merge with.

SETTINGS                                                   *linediff-settings*

                                                           *g:linediff_indent*
>
    let g:linediff_indent = 1
<

Default value: 0

If this flag is set to 1, linediff will reindent the diffed sections in order
to minimize differences caused by formatting. This may change the buffers'
contents.

                                                      *g:linediff_buffer_type*
>
    let g:linediff_buffer_type = 'scratch'
<
Default value: "tempfile"

This variable can have one of two values, "scratch" or "tempfile".

If it is set to "scratch", the created proxy buffer is not connected to any
file. The benefit is that the filename can then be set to be an informative
string instead of a weird temporary filename. The drawback is that you can't
run some external commands on this buffer, since there is no real backing
file.

If it is set to "tempfile" (the default), the proxy buffer is actually a
temporary file. The benefit is that you run external commands that expect an
actual file (like executing |:make|). The drawback is that the only way to
display information on the proxy is by hacking the statusline, which may cause
issues and can't work reliably on all statuslines.

                                            *g:linediff_first_buffer_command*
                                            *g:linediff_further_buffer_command*
>
    let g:linediff_first_buffer_command  = 'new'
    let g:linediff_further_buffer_command = 'vertical new'
<

Default values: "tabnew" and "rightbelow vertical new", respectively.

These variables control what commands are used to open the temporary
buffers. By default, the first one will open a blank new tab, and the
subsequent ones will split it vertically, from the right.
This should ensure a pretty sensible setup.

As an example, you can set them like so:
>
    let g:linediff_first_buffer_command  = 'leftabove new'
    let g:linediff_further_buffer_command = 'rightbelow vertical new'
<
With this, the buffers will be positioned in a split above the current buffer,
the first one on the left, and the subsequent ones on the right.

You can control the positioning with judicious use of |:rightbelow| and
|:leftabove|. If you omit these commands, the view will simply follow your
default settings when opening new splits.

                                                          *g:linediff_diffopt*
>
    let g:linediff_diffopt = 'filler,iwhite'
<
Default value: "builtin"

This variable contains the 'diffopt' to set while performing a linediff. You
may want to have a different value of that setting for linediff than you do
for other kinds of diffing.

The special value of "builtin" simply doesn't touch the setting at all.

Note that the 'diffopt' setting is global, which means that it will simply be
set globally and then reverted back to its previous setting once the linediff
is stopped.

                                                *g:linediff_modify_statusline*
>
    let g:linediff_modify_statusline = 0
<
Default value: 1

This setting controls whether linediff will attempt to put information about
the diffed areas in the statusline. It's on by default, but you can set it to
0 to leave the statusline untouched. You can access the description that would
have been put there with `b:differ.description`, within the buffer.

                                                *g:linediff_sign_highlight_group*
>
    let g:linediff_sign_highlight_group = "DiffChange"
<
Default value: "Search"

Name of the 'highlight' group which will be used by the |:sign| characters
displayed in the source buffer's "gutter".


==============================================================================
INTERNALS                                                 *linediff-internals*

When a block of text is diffed with the plugin, a "Differ" object is
initialized with its relevant data. The differ contains information about the
buffer number, filetype, start and end lines of the text, and a few other
things. Almost all functions the plugin uses are scoped to this object in
order to keep the interface simple. They're located under
"autoload/linediff/differ.vim" and should be fairly understandable.

Functions that are general-purpose utilities are placed in
"autoload/linediff/util.vim".

All differ objects that are required for the diff buffers are linked to each
other out of necessity. If they originate from a single buffer, updating one
would move the lines of the other, so that one would have to be updated as
well. There's a "controller" object that takes care of the high-level
interaction between them.

Closing ~

Closing a diff buffer requires closing all diff buffers, because there's no
longer any need in them existing. Turns out, this is a bit complicated in some
Vim versions, because of weird connections between buffers, their local
variables, and autocommands. On Vim 7.4.52, for instance, the plugin was able
to segfault the editor by double-closing buffers. This is why closing is a bit
of a complicated process.

These are the different scenarios:

- The user calls |:LinediffReset|: All diff buffers need to be closed. This
  is the easy process -- just go through all buffers and close them one by
  one, no dependencies.

- The user closes a single diff buffer: A |BufUnload| autocommand is
  triggered. That autocommand resets the differ (buffer id, line numbers,
  etc), bringing it to an inactive state, but doesn't close it, since it's
  already being closed. It sends a message to the Controller that the
  destruction process has started.

  From this point on, entering another window with a diff buffer destroys that
  one as well (the |WinEnter| event is used). On every destruction, the
  controller checks if all buffers have been cleared which would mean the
  destruction process is over. This is hacky, but seems to a sensible way to
  clear out all buffers, lazily, on older Vim versions.

- The user closes all diff buffers with |:tabclose| or by switching to a new
  tab and executing |:tabonly|: In this case, the |WinEnter| event never gets
  called, but every closed diff buffer cleans itself up. It also starts the
  "destroying" process in the Controller, but the Controller checks if there
  are live differs, and if there aren't any left, removes its "destroying"
  state, so that the next |WinEnter| wouldn't mess anything up.

In short, the first unloaded buffer starts a destruction process, which means
entering any diff buffer makes it self-destruct. If the buffers are all closed
at once, that's fine, because the destruction process stops itself once there
are no more live differs. Hacky, but seems to work.

ISSUES                                                       *linediff-issues*

You shouldn't linediff two pieces of text that overlap. Not that anything
horribly bad will happen, it just won't work as you'd hope to. I don't feel
like it's a very important use case, but if someone requests sensible
behaviour in that case, I should be able to get it working.
